Welcome to Open Library Developer Portal!
======================================================
Welcome to the developer hub of Open Library. This page has information about the following:
1. Resources that will help you get started accessing data from Open Library platform.
2. Resources that will help you integrating with Open Library platform.

:doc:`Accessing Books Data <AccessingData/index>`
--------------------------------------------------
Open Library offers free, public, low-volume Web APIs and bulk Monthly Data Dumps for accessing book and author catalog data. Here are examples of partners making use of our data in the wild. Our Web APIs are ideal for book services which need to make infrequent, real-time searches for specific books, their authors, and their availability. 
For projects which require importing books, authors, or covers in bulk, please kindly download our free data dumps.

--------------------------------------------------
We maintain an Official (Python) Client Library for accessing data and writing bots. The are also unofficial client libraries written in Ruby and Elixir.

:doc:`Partners <Partners>`
